            Starbucks was able to use its existing digital marketing tools and social media platform to successfully engage its customer base and increase customer loyalty. However, I believe the company can still consider it. Starbucks could not use the social media platform called Snapchat. This site is popular among young people between 14 to 25 years of age. This age group will be among the target consumers of this company. The platform allows customers to share videos and photos of themselves while enjoying Starbucks coffee from the comfort of their own home. When these videos trend, other people want to experience the same experience, so they buy coffee from Starbucks. Through this the company can increase its customer loyalty, attract new customers and increase its revenue
